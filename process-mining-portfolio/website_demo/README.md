# Website Demo — Structure (for WordPress or static site)

Create these pages to present results clearly, in a neutral/portfolio style:
- **Home** — What is Process Mining? Why this study? What you learned.
- **Tools** — Paste/format the comparison table from `tool_comparison/comparison_table.md`.
- **Case Study** — Summarize results from `docs/analysis_summary.md` and embed the generated figures (`process_tree.png`, `petri_net.png`).
- **Methodology** — Explain the capability dimensions and datasets used.
- **Contact / About** — Short bio + links to GitHub and notebook.

Tips:
- Keep tone academic and general — avoid implying it was created for one organization.
- Include dates and tool versions for transparency.
